# Consulting Services

??? warning "I'm currently at capacity until the end of March 2025"

If you're an engineering leader at a startup aiming to roll out your AI to production, I can help. My experience includes:

- Training teams transitioning to probabilistic applications
- Pivoting products to AI-powered solutions that collect data 
- Hiring and evaluating AI engineering teams

I've guided numerous companies through AI product development and know what works. For everything else, we can tap into a network of trusted experts. I focus on practical solutions over flashy models:

- Establish simple baselines
- Use straightforward systems
- Prioritize business outcomes

## My background is not like many others

I developed most of my skills at Stitchfix over the past 8 years. I mostly trained models, built production systems, and worked with data.

The mandate when I joined in 2016 was simply '*vision models work now, how do we make money, how do we get to product*'. I managed data labeling teams. I trained vision models to explore generative models and multi-modal embeddings. (This was to improve product search and relevance.)

Sound familiar?

- *Text works now, how do we make money?*
- *How do we do search?* 
- *How do we understand relevance?*
- *How do we build a system that can improve over time using user feedback?*
- *How do we set goals, prioritize experiments, and allocate resources?*



You might wonder why I don't start my own company. Sadly, a [hand injury](./writing/posts/hands-part-1.md) limits how much I can code. Because of this, I want my coding time to have the biggest impact possible. That's why I mainly focus on [instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com) and [education](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md).

## An investment in regret minimization

I've seen companies waste months and millions.

I can't promise you'll succeed or find product-market fit if we work together, but I can promise to help you make a clear plan, encourage your team to keep trying simple experiments, and focus on what really matters.

My job is simple: to tell you when what you think is easy is actually hard, and when what you think is hard is actually easy.

Success is about minimizing regret.

## What people are saying

### [Christian](https://twitter.com/cblovescode), Founder at Dunbar
Can attest that you've been tremendously helpful for the team at Dunbar, the value has gone beyond acceleration of our product too - best way I describe it is full-stack AI-business guidance in a box.

### [Taylor](https://twitter.com/tayhalliday), Head of Product at Zapier
Jason helped us accelerate our RAG offering at Zapier in so many ways. He's a pro if you're looking for someone to come in and give your AI product some added horsepower.

### [Avthar](https://twitter.com/avthars), Lead PM at Timescale
I highly recommend working with Jason. He's brought a wealth of experience and developer understanding to our team, helping us develop better ideas and move faster. 100% worth it.

### [Vitor](https://twitter.com/vitorbal), Staff Software Engineer at Zapier
Highly recommend reaching out to Jason if you want to level up your AI product and team! I always came out of our conversations with insights and ideas to make Zapier Central better.

### [Luke](https://twitter.com/lukeigel), CEO of Kino AI
Definitely speak with Jason if you're doing RAG, semantic search, etc. Amazingly helpful.

## How best to work with me

There are three ways to work with me:

1. **Subscription model**: Includes a 45-minute meeting each week, unlimited email/slack access, and my network of experts. I'll pay to help you with them.

2. **Project-based engagement**: We will tackle a specific initiative with a fixed scope and budget. This includes helping you write content, do research, and anything else you need.

3. **Traditional consulting relationship**: We meet every week to discuss strategy, planning, and execution. I may bring in extra staff.

I don't work on hourly rates, and my work is guaranteed. With the work that we're doing together, **I'm always happy to refund any fees.**

### Minimum Level of Engagement

If these are too much, I suggest reading my [blog](./writing/index.md) or check out my [course on improving RAG systems](./systematically-improve-your-rag.md) which is a fraction of the cost.

- **Async Support**: $9,500 per month, 45 minute weekly syncs and unlimited email/slack access.
- **Strategic Consulting**: Starts at $50k for the entire engagement
- **Comprehensive Consulting**: Starts at $120k for the entire engagement

For services beyond async support, I ask for at least a 3-month commitment. You can pay through Stripe, and my assistant will contact you after. Or, you can fill out our form, and we'll reach out to you. Right now, I'm fully booked until the end of April 2025.
